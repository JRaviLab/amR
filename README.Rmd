The goal of NewPackage is to ... < *your awesome package description here!* >

## GitHub Setup

### Repository

Initial Repository Configuration:

* Enable Git: `usethis::use_git()`
* Configure Remote: `usethis::use_github(organisation = "JRaviLab", private = TRUE, protocol = "https")`
* Contributor Code of Conduct: `usethis::use_code_of_conduct(contact = "janani.ravi@cuanschutz.edu")`

### GitHub Actions

These functions will enable common package development GitHub Actions is desired:

* R CMD Check (multiplatform): `usethis::use_github_action("check_standard")`
* Build Pkgdown: `use_github_action("pkgdown")`
* lint code: `use_github_action("lint")`
* style code: `use_github_action("style")`

Example GitHub Actions workflows have been incorporated into this template. Modify workflows in `.github/workflows/` or delete if these are not required.

## Development

* new function: `usethis::use_r("hello")`
* add package dependency: `usethis::use_package("rlang")`
* render documentation/update NAMESPACE: `devtools::document()`
* load changes without install: `devtools::load_all()`
* Local R CMD Check: `devtools::check()`


## Installation

You can install the development version of NewPackage like so:

``` r
# GitHub
devtools::install_github("JRaviLab/NewPackage", auth_token = "<PersonalAccessToken>")
# If Bioconductor Dependencies
BiocManager::install("JRaviLab/NewPackage", auth_token = "<PersonalAccessToken>")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(NewPackage)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
